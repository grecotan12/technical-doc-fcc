          <p>Open your computer case. Then remove both side panels for easy access to the motherboard tray. The motherboard tray can be removed from the case, which will allow you to easily install the motherboard without having to work at weird angles. Not all cases have removable motherboard trays.</p>
          <p>The motherboard tray is typically held in with two screws. Set these aside so that you don’t lose them.
Installing a motherboard typically means you are essentially building a new computer. You will need to reinstall your operating system if you are upgrading, and you will need to format any system drives. You cannot simply upgrade to a new motherboard without reinstalling everything on your computer.</p>
          <ul><li>Install the standoffs. Match the holes on the motherboard with the available standoff locations on the motherboard tray. Every case and motherboard tray is different, and all will have different hole configurations. Line up the motherboard to see where you can use standoffs to secure it. Every hole possible on your motherboard should have a standoff installed.</li></ul>

          <p>Thermal Paste: You'll need a thermal paste after installing the CPU, especially if you are planning to install the motherboard and mount the CPU cooler right after. You can, however, ignore it if your CPU cooler already has some pre-applied paste.</p>
          <p>CPU Cooler: It goes without saying that you need a CPU cooler to make sure the CPU doesn't overheat. This isn't optional, so be sure to grab either an air cooler or a liquid cooler.</p>
          <ul><li>Place the CPU on the socket, ensuring it sits easily and lays flat without having to apply any external force or pressure.</li></ul>

          <p>If there are any existing RAM modules that you need to remove, release the clips on either side of the module and gently pull it out. </p>
          <p>To install the new RAM, align the notch on the RAM stick with the ridge in the slot, and firmly press the RAM into the slot until the side clips snap into place, securing the RAM.</p>
          <ul><li>Push down the RAM stick straight down until it makes a clicking sound.</li></ul>

Find cards that are recommended for your interests. Different cards are best suited for different applications, though most cards excel at being jack-of-all-trades.
Be sure to read as many reviews as possible before deciding on a card. There are lots of resources online for finding the best performance for your budget. Sites such as Tom's Hardware will publish comparison charts ranking the current most popular cards in all price ranges, and customer reviews on sites such as Newegg can provide insight into the average person's experience with the card.</p>
          <p>
Open your case. To install your new graphics card (also called a GPU), you'll need to open your computer's case. Most modern cases have thumbscrews on the back that allow you to easily remove the side panels, but you may need a Phillips-head screwdriver to remove the screws on older cases</p>
          <ul><li>Ensure that your motherboard supports the card. Virtually all graphics cards are PCI-E these days, so you will need to ensure that you have at least one of these slots. They are typically located closest to the processor in the row of PCI slots. If you don't have any PCI-E slots, you may need to install a new motherboard if you want to upgrade your graphics card.[3]</li></ul>

          <p>You can skip this step if you have a 'fixed' PSU, as all the cables that feed power to the other components will be permanently attached. For modular and semi-modular PSUs, your first move is making sure that all these cases are connected to the main power supply.</p>
          <p>With the PSU fan-side down, slide it into the case’s PSU bay. This is usually at the back and in the floor of the case, except for very cheap or old cases that have it at the top.</p>
          <ul><li>Later sections of the PC building guide will show you exactly where to plug in each PSU cable, but you can make life easier for yourself by thinking in advance about where these cables are going to run. That way, when the time comes to do some actual cable management, you won’t have to unplug and replug them.</li></ul>

          <p>The first thing you want to do is find where the M.2 slot is on your motherboard. Look for a slot about one inch wide that protrudes from the motherboard about a quarter of an inch. Every motherboard is different, but the most common locations are below the CPU and around the PCIe slots in the lower half of the board. Check the manual if you have trouble finding it.</p>
          <p>Some motherboards have a pre-installed shield in place that serves as a heat spreader but also can provide a nice piece of visual flair. This will obviously have to be removed before you access the M.2 slot.</p>
          <ul><li>If your motherboard supports two M.2 SSDs you’ll need to consult your manual to see which slot is the recommended one for installing your boot drive. Each slot might offer different performance levels, while others might turn off a PCIe slot if used. In short,  read the manual first!</li></ul>
